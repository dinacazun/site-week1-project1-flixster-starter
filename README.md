### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yeah, I think the topics discussed prepared me to complete the assignment. Some things I had trouble using is embedding the API and using current page to show more results. If we spent a bit more time implementing or doing code alongs I think it would have clicked quicker.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Something I would have done is not focus too much on perfecting it and getting the things displayed in a cute fashion, but rather focus on getting it to work. I would have also made the movie cards smaller.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went better than I expected. I didn't think that I would get a working website, but I got some more movie results to show. Some things that didn't go as planned that the exit button wasn't working but I worked on after the demo. I really liked how my peers changed the font and added stars to their movie cards.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I wanna give a shoutout to Abbas and Emanda for lending me a helping hand on the website and being super kind.
